This project is a web interface that allows users to upload an image of their urine strip (see below) and identify the colors on the strip (see strip images below). Each strip
will have 10 colors. The input image is analyzed and return the results as a json with 10 colors (RGB values).

*Web App specifications*
a. The image is entered through API.
b. Web interface is build by React.js.
c. Django is used as a backend framework.
d.The image processing model is not a state-of-art model which needs improvement.
